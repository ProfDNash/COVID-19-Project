# Death Viz
![US-Deaths-Sample-Image](https://github.com/ProfDNash/COVID-19-Project/blob/master/DeathViz/USdeaths.png)
The goal is to create an animation visualizing all deaths from COVID-19 in the continental U.S. by placing a random point within each county to represent a single death within that county.  Above is a sample image of what the final frame of that animation might look like.

COVID-19 data for this project comes from https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/
Map boundary shape files (both state and county level) come from https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
